# Functional-Programming

Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands

## Declarative Programming

Functional programming languages are declarative, meaning that a computation's logic is expressed without describing its control flow. In declarative programming, there are no statements. Instead, programmers use expressions to tell the computer what needs to be done, but not how to accomplish the task.
